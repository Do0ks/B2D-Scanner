<b><u>Discription:</u></b>

Inject into any game. If you have a solid base address and need to trace a pointer to a dynamic address, this will find one for you (Which is likely to break), but this is extreamly helpful and powerful if you know of a solid base address with some good pointers, this tool will find the dynamic address along with the missing pointers quicly giving you a solid pointer chain. I made this for the things I couldn't find in UEDumper, but could be applied to other methods.
